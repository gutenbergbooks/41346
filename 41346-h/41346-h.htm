<h2><a name="INTRODUCTION" id="INTRODUCTION"></a>INTRODUCTION</h2>


<p>From the standpoint of the biographer,
it is to be regretted that more of the
great Italian artists of the fifteenth century
were not associated with the Church. In
the days of the most interesting activity of
painters and sculptors, the capacity to write<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
was rarely met beyond the monasteries
and few people took the trouble to record
any impression of notable men in the early
years of their career. We are apt to forget
that, for one artist whose name is preserved
to us to-day, there are a score of men whose
work has perished, whose very names are
forgotten. In middle life, or in old age,
when commissions from Popes or Emperors
had attracted the attention of the world at
large to the best men of the time, there
might be some chronicler found to make
passing but invaluable reference to those
of his contemporaries whose names were
common in men&rsquo;s mouths, but such notes
were made in very haphazard fashion, they
were not necessarily accurate, and might
be founded upon personal observation or
rumour, or even upon the prejudice that
was inevitable when Italy was a congerie
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>of opposing states. Latter-day historians
grope painfully and conscientiously after the
scanty records of great painters, searching
the voluminous writings of men who have
little to say, and very little authority for
saying anything about the great personalities
of the art world of their time. It is
not surprising, under these circumstances,
that despite much search the record of
many lives that must have been fascinating
cannot be found. We learn more of the
man from his work than we can hope to
learn from any written record and, as the
taste for studying pictures grows, so all
the internal evidence of a man&rsquo;s thought
and ways of life accumulates and the
message that underlies canvas and stands
revealed in colour and line to the trained
eye, is translated for the benefit of a
curious generation. We learn to know<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
what manner of man the painter was from
the models he chose, the portraits he
painted, the qualities and nature of his
landscape, the expression of his joy in
light and air, his feeling for flowers and
birds. By a process of synthetical reasoning
we come to see, though it be as in a
glass, darkly, the picture that every man
paints, from the years of his activity to the
last year of his sojourn among mortals&mdash;that
is the portrait of himself. Doubtless
we are often misled, because as each critic,
artist or layman, finds in the picture a reflection
of what he takes there, it remains
difficult to arrive at definite conclusions
upon which all men can agree about any
painter. Happily the effort pleases our own
generation, and as there are many great
men who flourished in the fifteenth century
and have left their pictures to be their sole
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
monument, there is no lack of work.
Naturally in this curious and inquisitive
age there are some who would rather discover
a well authenticated story about an
artist&rsquo;s life than an unexpected masterpiece
from his hand, but then the appeal of
letters is always more widespread than
that of paint. It is always pleasant to
endeavour to supply a want, but it is only
fair to remember that in writing about
people whose life story was not preserved
by their contemporaries, the path is strewn
with pitfalls.</p>

<p class="blockquot">This picture, which is of bust length and life size, is one of the
ten examples of Giovanni Bellini in the National Gallery, and is
perhaps the most important example of the artist as a portrait
painter. The Doge wears his state robes and cap of office, and
the picture is signed on a cartellino.</p>

<p>In dealing with the Italians from the days
of Cimabue to Clovio, it has been the custom
to depend very largely upon the works of
Giorgio Vasari, and to rely for later and
more accurate information upon the volumes
written by Crowe and Cavalcaselle, passing
from them to Morelli and Berenson.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
Vasari, to whom the students of Italian art,
down to the middle of the sixteenth century,
are so deeply indebted, was born in 1512,
and lived for more than sixty years. He
was a painter and architect, related to
Luca Signorelli, and engaged for a great
part of his life upon work in Arezzo. He
was a great copyist, a painstaking writer,
and never did critic wield a milder pen if
he chanced to be writing of Florentine art,
or a more prejudiced one if he dealt with
things of Venice. He was first a patriot
and then a critic. One night, he tells us,
a friend of Monsignore Giovio expressed a
wish to add to his library a treatise on
men who had distinguished themselves
in the arts of design, from the time of
Cimabue down to the year of the conversation.
Vasari undertook the work and
founded it, he says, upon notes and memo<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>randa
which he had made from the time
when he was a boy. The compilation was
finished about the year 1547, it was written
at a time when the painter was very busy
with commissions. He did his best in a
certain prejudiced fashion, and the result
for all its defects is very valuable. Naturally
enough Vasari had not too large a share
of the gifts required for his task, nor had
he the necessary facts before him for writing
really reliable history. Much that he wrote
was accepted <i>faute de mieux</i>, but modern
researches have necessitated a revision of
very many estimates that Vasari formed
for us, together with a considerable portion
of his facts, and we have learned to understand
something of the source and direction
of his prejudices.</p>

<p>The literary union of Crowe and Cavalcaselle,
who started their joint work in the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
latter half of the nineteenth century, with
better equipment of facts and a larger
measure of critical insight, has been far more
valuable, and a complete popular edition of
their work revised by sympathetic and well
qualified writers is greatly to be desired;
but in no case can we regard a volume
devoted to the biographies of scores of
artists as being altogether reliable. The
spirit of study is abroad, to-day men will
devote more time to the life story of a comparatively
obscure artist than they would
have given fifty years ago to half-a-dozen
painters of European reputation. It is not
easy, one might almost say it is not possible,
to tell succinctly the story of men who
have left no clear record and were not regarded
by their contemporaries as fit and
proper subjects for a biography. At best
we can study the available sources of in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>formation,
and use such measure of judgment
as is in us to construct a reasonable and
likely narrative. To delve in all manner of
likely and unlikely places, to study and
make allowances for the prejudices of the
time, to rely upon the painted canvas to
confirm or confute the printed word&mdash;these
are the tasks of the conscientious biographer
who must not be ill content if, after sifting
an intolerable amount of chaff, he can find
a few forgotten grains of corn.</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2><a name="I" id="I"></a>I<br />

<small>GIAN BELLINI&rsquo;S YOUTH</small></h2>


<p>Giovanni, or Gian Bellini as he is
generally called, the subject of this brief
record and appreciation, is one of the most
fascinating painters of the fifteenth century.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
He has left many a lovely picture to the
world, but alas he was no diarist, he had
no Boswell, and there are gaps in the
history of his life that will never be filled
up. In the vast and unexplored region of
Italian archives there may be some facts
that research will bring to light, but at present
we know very little, and can only be
grateful that the story of his life is not
shrouded altogether in the mist that obscures
so much of the personal history of
eminent Venetians in the fifteenth century.</p>

<p>&ldquo;When zealous efforts are supported by
talent and rectitude, though the beginning
may appear lowly and poor, yet do they
proceed constantly upwards by gradual
steps, never ceasing nor taking rest until
they have finally attained to the summit
of distinction.&rdquo; In this fashion Giorgio
Vasari, who in those admirable but unre<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>liable
&ldquo;Lives,&rdquo; seldom fails to speak kindly
and enthusiastically of artists whom neither
he nor his friends had occasion to dislike,
begins his account of the house of Bellini.
He passes on to deal in detail with Jacopo
Bellini, the father of that Giovanni with
whose life and work it is proposed to deal
briefly in this place. Of the father little is
known, but he is said to have lived in the
shadow of St. Mark&rsquo;s great Cathedral in
Venice, and to have worked under some of
the Umbrian masters in the Ducal Palace.
He must have served and studied in the
studio of Gentile da Fabriano in days when
Fra Angelico had not reached the Convent
of San Marco; there is evidence, too, that
he travelled and painted portraits. The
date of his death is as uncertain as the
year of his birth. It is said that the new
paganism held more attractions for him<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
than the old faith, and that the most of
his commissions were from the great and
flourishing secular institutions of the Republic.
Little is left of his pictures, but
a few delightful sketches are preserved in
Paris and London and, but for the larger
fame of his sons, Jacopo Bellini would
doubtless have been forgotten to-day, and
such work as is left would be attributed by
leading critics to different masters.</p>

<p>Gentile Bellini seems to have been born
between 1425 and 1430 and the date of
Giovanni&rsquo;s birth is not known definitely.
It may be associated with the year 1430.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 100%;">
<a name="Page_24" id="Page_24"></a>
<span class="caption">PLATE III.&mdash;ANGEL PLAYING A LUTE</span>
<p class="blockquot">This is a detail from an altar-piece formerly in the Church of
San Giobb&eacute;. The work is now in the Academy of Venice.</p>

<img src="images/i_025.jpg" width="60%" alt="PLATE III.&mdash;ANGEL PLAYING A LUTE" title="" />
</div>

<p>At this time it must be remembered
that Venice was on the road to her ultimate
decline. Costly wars with Milan and
Florence had seriously damaged the Exchequer,
the fratricidal sea-fights with Genoa
had cost a wealth of human life and treasure
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
and, although Venice had annexed nearly a
dozen provinces in half a century, the outlay
had been out of proportion to the results.
At the same time, the Venetians did not
know that their splendid state was on the
downward road. The new route to India
was unknown. Columbus and Diaz had yet
to withdraw the sea-borne commerce of the
world from Venice to Spain, and so bring
about the commercial ruin of the Republic,
and the Republic, with her maritime trade
and her wealth of spoils from the East, could
furnish endless material for the artists who
were rising in her midst. Everywhere there
was colour in abundance, the &ldquo;Purple East&rdquo;
cast a broad shadow upon the Adriatic.
Then, again, it is worth remarking that the
Venetian painters did not concern themselves,
as their Florentine brothers did, with
matters lying beyond the scope of their<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
canvas, they did not dally with architecture
or sculpture in the intervals of picture
painting. In short, pictures represented
the tribute of Venice to the arts, and this
concentration was not without its influence
upon the work done. Literature did not
flourish, because the city reared few literary
men and the tendency of the citizens was
towards pleasure rather than study. All
could admire a picture at a time when few
could read a book, and the spirit of the
Renaissance, fluttering over the Venetian
Republic, had done little more than waken
its people to a sense of the beauty of the
human form. Although in the days when
Gian Bellini was a little boy, the terror of
the Turkish invasion was upon the eastern
end of the Mediterranean, it had hardly
reached Venice or, if it had, only through
the medium of envoys and kings who came<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
to ask the assistance of the Republic to
keep the Turk from Constantinople. To
these appeals the response of Venice in
those days could not be very efficacious,
but the envoys added a more flamboyant
note to the city&rsquo;s colouring, and served an
artistic if not a political purpose.</p>

<p>Vasari tells us that Jacopo Bellini painted
his pictures not on wood, but on canvas.
&ldquo;In Venice,&rdquo; he writes na&iuml;vely, &ldquo;they do
not paint on panel, or if they do use it
occasionally they take no other wood but
that of the fir, which is most abundant in
that city, being brought along the river
Adige in large quantities from Germany.
It is the custom then in Venice to paint
very much upon canvas, either because
this material does not so readily split, is
not liable to clefts, and does not suffer
from the worm, or because pictures on<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
canvas may be made of such size as is
desired, and can also be sent whithersoever
the owner pleases, with little cost and
trouble.&rdquo; Perhaps Vasari overlooked the
effect of sea air upon open frescoed walls,
although that effect was clear enough to
the Venetians. But Jacopo, for all that he
painted upon canvas, and was employed by
some of the leading Venetian guilds, makes
no outstanding figure upon the page of the
art history of Venice. He seems to have
lived prosperously, honourably, and intelligently,
to have caught the earliest possible
reflection of the growing spirit of paganism,
thereby incurring the anger and mistrust
of the Church party that had regarded
painting as the proper intermediary between
faith and the general public, to have
pleased his state employers in Venice and
Padua, and then to have died rather outside<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
the odour of sanctity, leaving an honourable
name behind him, and children who were
destined to spread its fame far and wide.</p>

<p>Students of Gian Bellini&rsquo;s life and work
can see that only a part of the father&rsquo;s
teaching fell upon fruitful soil. Jacopo
Bellini, as we have seen, was a man in
whom the early religious spirit that the
Renaissance did much to cloud over was
of small account, but the pagan revival
that found so many adherents in Florence
and Venice, towards the close of the fifteenth
century, left young Gian Bellini
almost untouched. We shall see that the
commissions offered by wealthy patrons,
who had no love for sacred subjects, were
either rejected, or were accepted and not
fulfilled. It is surely permissible to believe
that the teaching of early days had a
lasting influence upon the outlook of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
two Bellinis, and strengthened them in the
determination to do work that appealed as
much to their heart as to their hand. Certainly
they followed conscience where it led
them. In the case of Gian Bellini, with whom
we are mostly concerned here, it is interesting
to see that his long life, passed as it
was in the very critical time that embraced
the fall of Constantinople and the League
of Cambrai, was completely free from cloud.
His mind was formed very early. He worked
strenuously, carefully, and in the fashion that
pleased his conscience, till within a very
short time of his death, and the serenity of
his spirit, clearly revealed in a series of
exquisite pictures, was untouched by all
that happened in the world around him.</p>

<p>Changes came thick and fast upon Venice
in the years when Bellini was hard at work,
and new ideas were receiving acceptance<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
on every hand. The Renaissance, with its
revival of pagan thought in the train of
learning, scattered new ideas throughout the
Venetian studios. Bellini&rsquo;s pupil and successor
Titian could depict pagan goddess
and Christian Deity with equal facility.
Giorgione was travelling along the same
paths when death overtook him, but Gian
Bellini, while he continued to make progress
in his art, refused to make any concession
to the pagan spirit, and with one possible
exception in the case of the Bacchanals, a
picture painted for the Duke of Ferrara,
now in the Alnwick Castle Collection, his
last pictures were as devout in thought and
feeling as the first.</p>

<p>It seems strange, perhaps, to express
doubts about a picture that bears the painter&rsquo;s
signature, and has been freely accepted as
the work of his hands, but we must not forget<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
that the fifteenth-century painters in Italy
were the directors of a school as well as
the tenants of a studio. The Bellini and
Vivarini families were at the head of Venetian
painters, and consequently the best students
of the time were attracted to their studios,
content to mix colours, prepare canvases, and
paint the less important parts of a commissioned
picture. After a time they even
painted pictures, and signed them with the
master&rsquo;s name. We have certain facts in
connection with the Ferrara picture, and
few facts are to be found in the case of any
others. It is on record that Bellini took an
unfinished picture to Ferrara, completed it
under the eye of the Duke, and received
eighty-five ducats for it. The question
becomes whether this is the picture now at
Alnwick that Titian finished, because those
who know it say that the background has
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
a landscape of the familiar Titian kind, with
glimpses of Cadore and Pieve, where the
younger painter was born. We are left, then,
with the almost certain knowledge that Titian
painted a part of the &ldquo;Bacchanal&rdquo; picture,
and that the other part is opposed in sentiment
to Bellini&rsquo;s theories of art. So the sceptics
do not lack a measure of justification.</p>

</div>

<p>In the latter days of his life Bellini&rsquo;s
studio became something like a factory, and
there seems very little reason to doubt that
some of his clever pupils like Bondinelli,
Bissolo, Marconi, Catena and others were
allowed to sign, with the master&rsquo;s name,
&ldquo;Ioannes Bellinus,&rdquo; pictures that had no
more than the slightest acquaintance with
the master&rsquo;s brush. One of the most distinguished
of our modern critics, Mr. Bernhard
Berenson, attended an exhibition of Venetian
pictures held in London a few years ago, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
found that the great majority of the pictures
attributed to Bellini were by his pupils. He
pointed out then that the signature upon
which the unfortunate owners were accustomed
to lean was no better than a broken
reed. Bellini, of course, was not the only
offender in this respect. His great pupil
Titian copied the master&rsquo;s fault, and there
is on record a letter from Frederic, Duke of
Mantua, asking Titian to send out work that
has his touch as well as his signature. With
these facts before us, it becomes permissible
to doubt whether Bellini, in the last years of
a long life devoted to sacred work, elected
to turn aside, and yield deliberately to the
pagan movement he had opposed so long.
We can find no other work of his hand
that is directly opposed to his theories
of religious art, though it is fair to remember
that he had a very active mind,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
and even responded to the influence of his
own great pupils Titian and Giorgione.</p>

<small>MIDDLE LIFE</small></h2>


<p>It is not easy to say how far a great
painter reflects his time and how far he
influences it. Tradition and surroundings
must needs count for much, but their exact
value is not easy to estimate. Indeed the
influence of a man is often strongest upon
the generations that succeed to his own, for
no hints are left of the doubts and difficulties
that beset the master. The attitude of
the Venetians towards art in the fifteenth
century, when Gian Bellini started his work,
differed from that of the Florentines by
reason of the splendid isolation of Venice.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
The State was a law to herself; she instituted
her own customs, she ruled her
own life. Her wars had less effect than
her commercial victories upon those of her
citizens who turned their thoughts towards
art, the stress and strife beyond her boundaries
left her artists comparatively untouched.
The wider significance of the
Renaissance hardly reached her, her people
were not only pleasure-loving, but self-centred.
Happily, Jacopo Bellini was by
way of being a traveller and his experiences
were not lost upon his children. He knew
Florence and worked in the city at a time
when her great men were beginning to
rise in all their lasting glory, he may have
seen Brunelleschi himself at work upon the
Duomo. He knew Padua, where the tradition
of Giotto was very strong, though that
great master himself had long passed away,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
and so he brought to the art he practised
in his own city something of the technique
of the new movement, as well as the very
definite touch of the pagan sentiment that
was to be developed in all its beauty by his
son&rsquo;s pupils Titian and Giorgione. The
effect of his travels, limited though they
were, was very lasting, and though Gian
Bellini did not see life as his father had seen
it, his work paved the way for the masters
whose work was in some aspects greater
than his. In his early days Venice had no
very distinctive art. What there was seems
to have been ecclesiastical in thought and
extremely formal in design. It was the appeal
of the clericals to a people who could
neither write nor read, but although a State
may erect boundaries and may devote itself
to the enjoyment of prosperity, those who
care for the claims of art cannot escape<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
altogether from the forces that are at work
in surrounding cities. One of the chief
forces at work in Northern Italy was the
revival of learning that seems to have
marched side by side with the discovery of
personal beauty. The Church had kept
beauty in the background, the Renaissance
brought it to the canvas of every artist.
Bellini turned the discovery of personal
beauty to the service of the Madonna.</p>

<img src="images/i_043.jpg" width="85%" alt="PLATE V.&mdash;PIETA" title="" />
</div>

<p>Students of the life of Fra Angelico know
that a Dominican preacher exercised a very
great effect upon the painter&rsquo;s life, and was
responsible for sending him, at a very early
age, to the great Convent of the Dominicans
at Fiesole. There he was received as a
brother, and from the shelter of the cloister
he gave his art message to the world, his
story being preserved to us at the same
time because the progress of the Dominicans<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
was recorded. A few years later Giovanni
Bellini, then a boy newly in his teens, would
seem to have fallen under a very similar
influence. He was not fourteen when St.
Bernardino came to Padua and preached
the doctrine of godliness and Jew-baiting
to a people who were not ill-disposed towards
asceticism. In the fifteenth century
a boy of fourteen was a man. The Pope
made Cardinals of lads who were still younger
and many, who have left their names written
large in Italian history, were married when
they were fifteen. Gian Bellini would have
been assisting his father in the decoration
of the Gattemelata Chapel of Padua at
the time and there is no doubt that St.
Bernardino&rsquo;s addresses impressed him very
deeply. To be sure he did not go into a
religious house after the fashion of Fra
Angelico, but he turned his thoughts towards<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
religion, and for the rest of his long life his
brush was kept almost exclusively for the
service of sacred art. The tendencies towards
paganism that his father is known
to have shown held no attraction for him.
He sought to express the beauty of the
New Testament stories, and it is hard to
find throughout all Italy an artist whose
achievements in that direction can vie
with his, for Gian Bellini brought sensuous
beauty and rare qualities of emotion to
canvas for the first time in the history of
painting.</p>

<p>In those early days of the middle century
there were two acknowledged leaders of
painting in the world that young Bellini
knew. The first was his father, who is said
to have studied in the studios of Gentile da
Fabriano (1370 to 1450), and that of Pisanello
who was born somewhere about the same<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
time as da Fabriano, and died a year later.
It is worth noting that Jacopo Bellini called
one of his sons Gentile after his earliest
master, though whether Gentile or Giovanni
was the elder son remains uncertain. Mr.
Roger Fry, who writes with great authority
upon the subject, is of opinion that Gian
may have been a natural son of Jacopo, and
in those days when Popes had &ldquo;nephews&rdquo; in
abundance, and the marriage vow was more
honoured in the breach than the observance,
very little stigma attached to illegitimacy.
The other great painter of Gian Bellini&rsquo;s
time was the Paduan painter Squarcione,
who presided over a large and flourishing
school in his native city, and did work that
was quite as good as that of his contemporaries.
He adopted as his son a lad from
Padua or Mantua named Andrea Mantegna,
who was destined to take such high rank<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
among the painters of the Venetian
School.</p>

<p>Although Padua and Venice were in a
sense rivals, there seems to have been a
very friendly understanding for many years
between Squarcione and Jacopo Bellini, so
that Gian and Gentile were able to watch
the progress of the Paduan master and his
pupils, and to decide for themselves how
much they would accept, and what they
would reject of the teaching. In early years
these influences must have been of great
value to the painter, but happily they were
not destined to be lasting, for when Gian&rsquo;s
sister married Andrea Mantegna, Squarcione
quarrelled with his adopted son, and the
intimacy with the Bellini family came to an
end. This is as it should have been in the
best interests of Gian Bellini&rsquo;s art, for when
he returned to Venice and settled down<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
there permanently, he was able to follow his
own ideas, and free himself from what was
bad in the influence of the stiff, formal, and
lifeless school of Padua.</p>

<p>Venice must have been a remarkable city
in those years. To-day it stimulates the
imagination as few cities in Europe can do,
then it must have been one of the wonders
of the world. There are some striking
accounts of the city written in the latter
part of the fifteenth century, and though
space does not permit any quotation at
length, one brief paragraph will not be out
of place. Philippe de Comines, envoy of
Charles VIII., came to Venice in 1494, and
recalled his impressions of that city in his
memoirs. &ldquo;I was taken along the High
Street,&rdquo; he writes, &ldquo;they call it the Grand
Canal, and it is very broad, galleys cross it;
and it is the fairest street, I believe, that may<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
be in the whole world, and fitted with the
best houses; the ancient ones are painted,
and most have a great piece of porphyry
and serpentine on the front. It is the most
triumphant city I have ever seen, and doth
most honour to ambassadors and strangers.
It doth most wisely govern itself,
and the service of God is most solemnly
performed. Though the Venetians have
many faults, I believe God has them in
remembrance for the reverence they pay
in the service of His Church.&rdquo; This brief
tribute to the charm of Venice is of special
value because it helps us to understand why
the Venetians were not strenuous seekers
after knowledge, why their painters did no
more than paint, and why their response to
the humanities was so small. It explains
the decorative quality of Bellini&rsquo;s pictures,
the splendour of their colours. Pageantry
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
and ceremonial were the great desires of
Venetian life, the man who could add to
the lustre of a State procession along the
splendid water-way of the Grand Canal
was more to them than the scholar who
had written a treatise that moved the more
learned Florentines to admiration. Life was
so full of pleasure, so varied in its appeals,
that the Venetians could not spare time, or
even develop the will to study. They had
raised the old cry &ldquo;panem et circenses&rdquo; and,
in the days of Gian Bellini, there was no
lack of either. History is full of records
that reveal other nations in a similar light,
philosophers have drawn the inevitable conclusions&mdash;and
the trend of life is no wise
altered.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 100%;">
<a name="Page_50" id="Page_50"></a>
<span class="caption">PLATE VI.&mdash;ALLEGORY: THE BARQUE OF LOVE</span>
<p class="blockquot">This is one of a little series of panel pictures by Bellini that
may be seen in the Academy at Venice. The others depict Evil,
Fate, Luxury, and Zeal, and Prudence. This picture is sometimes
called &ldquo;Venus ruling the World,&rdquo; but such a title seems rather
foreign to the painter&rsquo;s own attitude.</p>

<img src="images/i_054.jpg" width="60%" alt="PLATE VI.&mdash;ALLEGORY: THE BARQUE OF LOVE" title="" />
</div>

<p>Under Bellini, painting lost the conventions
that had been regarded as correct or
inevitable in Squarcione&rsquo;s studio, and Gian&rsquo;s<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
pictures bear the same relation to those of
the Paduan, and his pupil, as Newman&rsquo;s
writing bears to bad eighteenth-century
English prose. But despite all developments
in the technique of his art, Gian Bellini&rsquo;s
painting remained quite constant to the
mood that St. Bernardino had induced.
Doubtless, had his gifts been of another kind,
he would have entered the Church, he would
have dreamed dreams and seen visions that
would not have found such world-wide expression
while, being an artist, inheriting
artistic traditions from his father, living in
the centre of the small world of Venetian
and Paduan painters, he expressed his
beautiful emotions in fashion that has not
weakened its claim upon us in more than
four hundred years. The glamour of Venetian
life, the extraordinary beauty of the
city that was his home, the splendour and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
the pageants that were part of a Venetian
life, the intensity of the colour that surrounded
him on all sides&mdash;some of it belonging
to Venice by right, and even more,
brought to her shores by the ceaseless traffic
of the sea&mdash;all these things developed and
deepened the emotion that was to find so
exquisite an expression from his brush. To
him, as to Fra Angelico, faith was a real and
living thing, and like the great monk who
died at ripe age while he was yet a boy,
Gian Bellini became a lover of the world in
its most picturesque aspect, accepting without
hesitation the traditional explanation of
its creation.</p>

<p>Naturally enough his appeal to the artist
is founded upon a dozen considerations,
mostly technical, his appeal to the layman
is direct and spontaneous. A countryman
who has never seen a studio can respond to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
the exquisite beauty of Bellini&rsquo;s Virgins and
Children, can feel the charm of the sunshine
that fills the air and lights sea and land,
can recognise the infinite glamour of the
roads that wind away into the mysterious
distance of the background, can enjoy the
rich, almost sensuous, colouring. Perhaps
had Bellini taken the vows, a great part of
these beauties would have been lost, the
infinite variety of lovely women and children
could hardly have been secured. As a
Venetian, and a pleasure lover, he could
not have responded, as Fra Angelico did,
to the restricted life and rigid discipline
of a religious order.</p>

<p>It was not easy for Gian Bellini to
devote himself entirely to sacred subjects
if he wished to earn a living by his brush,
because his father had stood outside the
Church. In those days, too, the best church<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>work
was in the hands of one family, the
Vivarini, whose monopoly was hardly likely
to be disturbed by an artist who could
show no better credentials than a connection,
legitimate or illegitimate, with a painter
whose feeling was distinctly pagan. Jacopo
Bellini, for all that he was a most admired
artist, had no claims upon the Church, and
does not seem to have received many commissions
from it. Various wealthy societies
in Venice had been accustomed to employ
him to decorate their halls with work that,
as we have said before, has been lost, and
their guilds or <i>scuole</i> would doubtless have
given Gian all the work he wished to do
had he been satisfied to do it.</p>

<p>He could not choose for himself. St.
Bernardino had chosen for him in those
years when his mind was most impressionable.
Gian Bellini&rsquo;s hand was doubtless<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
to be seen in Padua where he assisted
his father, and his earliest independent
work is to be found in the Casa Correr
at Venice, where one finds a &ldquo;Transfiguration,&rdquo; a
&ldquo;Crucifixion,&rdquo; and two &ldquo;Pietas.&rdquo;
He painted portraits, one from our own
National Gallery is to be seen here. This is
a picture of the Doge, Leonardo Loredano,
who held office from 1501 to 1521.</p>

<p>The early pictures reveal Bellini at the
parting of the ways. His figures have many
of the defects of the School of Padua. His
knowledge of anatomy is decidedly small,
he lacks confidence in himself, and yet it
is not difficult to recognise that the painter
is moving into a new country, that his
presentation of sacred subjects is developing
on lines that must add considerably to
their artistic value and to the permanence
of their appeal.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span></p>

<p>An amusing story is told of the way in
which young Bellini acquired his knowledge
of oil painting. He is said to have
assumed the dress of a Venetian nobleman,
and to have gone to the studio of a popular
artist of the time, under pretext of having
his portrait painted. While the artist, one
Antonello of Messina, was busily engaged
upon his portrait, Bellini is said to have
watched the process very carefully and to
have secured the much needed lesson. It is
more than likely that the story is untrue, but
it has obtained a large measure of credence.</p>

<p>His first big altar-piece is said to have
been done for the altar of St. Catherine of
Sienna, and after one or two other church
paintings had been accomplished, Giovanni
was commissioned to decorate the great
Council Hall of Venice with historical
paintings. But it is well to remember that<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
altar painting never ceased to interest him,
his greatest achievements having been accomplished
for churches. There are few
things in art more beautiful than Gian
Bellini&rsquo;s altar-pieces. Ruskin has paid a
special tribute to the &ldquo;Virgin and Four
Saints&rdquo; in the church dedicated to St.
Zaccaria, father of the Baptist. He says
that the Zaccaria altar-piece, and the one
in the Frari, by the same master, are the
two finest pictures in the world. Of the big
works, however, nothing remains, Gentile
being the only one of the family who is represented
to-day by pictures painted on a very
large scale. Vasari tells us that Gian painted
four pictures in fulfilment of a commission,
one representing the Pope Alexander III.
receiving Frederic Barbarossa after the
abjuration of the Schism of 1177, the next
showing the Pope saying Mass in San Marco,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
another representing his Holiness
in the act of presenting a canopy to the
Doge, and the last in which the Pontiff is
presented with eight standards and eight
silver trumpets by clergy assembled outside
the gates of Rome. These subjects or some
of them had been painted by one Gueriento
of Verona when Marco Corner was Doge.
Petrarch had written the inscriptions for
them, but they had faded, and in later years
Tintoretto painted his &ldquo;Paradiso&rdquo; over the
damaged frescoes. There is a story to the
effect that Giovanni and Gentile Bellini had
promised the councillors that their pictures
should last two hundred years; as a matter
of fact, they would seem to have been
destroyed by fire within half that period.</p>

<p>The style of the picture commissioned
makes its own significant commentary upon
the times. It was always considered advis<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>able
to stir in the Venetians appreciation for
State ceremonial, which encouraged so much
of the pageantry associated with Venetian
life and, even if Giovanni Bellini had no
keen taste for such work, he could not
refuse a commission that would establish
his name among his fellow countrymen.

<h2><a name="III" id="III"></a>III<br />

<small>THE LATTER DAYS</small></h2>


<p>Shortly after the Council Hall pictures
had been undertaken, in 1479, to be exact,
the Sultan, Mohammed II., conqueror of
Constantinople, wished to have his portrait<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
painted, and applied to the Doge of Venice
to send him a competent artist to do the
work. It should be remembered that the
Sultan had been waging a successful war
upon Venice, and that in January 1479 the
State had ceded Scutari, Stalimene, and
other territory and had agreed to pay an indemnity
of 200,000 ducats, with a tribute of
10,000 ducats a year for trading rights and
the exercise of consular jurisdiction in Constantinople.
Naturally the success of the
Turks, who had taken Constantinople in
1454, was making a very great impression
throughout Europe, and Venice had striven
to the uttermost to rouse the Powers to concerted
action, but in those days nobody was
anxious to trust the Republic. These are
matters, of course, that pertain to history
rather than art, but it is curious to remember
that throughout the times when<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
the watchers from St. Mark&rsquo;s Tower saw
the reflected glare of burning cities, when
the security of Christian Europe was
threatened seriously, when plagues were
devastating Venice, Gian Bellini seems to
have gone on his way all undisturbed,
painting his pictures in the most leisurely
fashion, and the fact that art stood right
above politics and strife is clearly shown
in the action of the Sultan in sending to
Venice for a good artist as soon as peace
had been restored. There seems to have
been some question of sending Gian because
his brother was busily engaged on
other work in the Ducal Palace, but after
a while it was decided to send Gentile, who
painted a portrait of the Sultan that found
its way afterwards into the Layard Collection
in Venice. Some surprise has been
expressed that the Sultan should have<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
allowed any one to paint his portrait, because
portrait painting is forbidden by the
Koran<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a>, but Mohammed II. was a man of
very advanced ideas and he not only gave
sittings to Gentile Bellini, but treated him
with the greatest favour, dismissing him
with many marks of approval and great
gifts. Among the presents brought back
to Venice by the painter were the armour
and sword of the great Doge Dandolo, who
had been buried in the year 1205 in the
private chapel in St. Sophia. Mohammed II.
had caused the great tomb to be destroyed,
but he sent the great patriot&rsquo;s armour back
to its native land. Vasari tells us that the
meeting between the brothers on Gentile&rsquo;s
return to Venice was most affectionate.</p>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_1_1" id="Footnote_1_1"></a><a href="#FNanchor_1_1"><span class="label">[1]</span></a> Mohammed said: &ldquo;If ye must make pictures, make them of
trees and things without souls. Verily every painter is condemned
to hell fire.&rdquo;</p></div>

<p>This journey to Constantinople would<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
seem to have added to the reputation of the
house of Bellini, and to have increased the
demand for portraits by both brothers. This,
in its way, would doubtless have led to the
multiplying of school pieces. History has
very little to tell of the progress of the
brothers during the years that followed.
We know that the Doge Loredano, whose
portrait has been painted by Gian Bellini,
succeeded to his high office in 1501, that
Titian would have been working in Bellini&rsquo;s
studio then, and that Bellini himself was in
the enjoyment of what was known as a
broker&rsquo;s patent, and was official painter to
the State. His was the duty of painting the
portrait of every Doge who succeeded to the
control of Venetian affairs during his term
of office, and he also painted any historical
picture in which the Doge had to figure.
There was a salary attached to the office,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
and the work was quite light. As far as we
can tell Gian Bellini was still averse from
painting secular subjects. He was now an
old man, but he had made great progress in
his work, conquering many of the difficulties
of perspective, shadow, and colouring that
had baffled his predecessors. The pageants
demanded by the great Mutual Aid Societies
(<i>Scuole</i>) from the artists in their employ, he
would seem to have left to his brother
Gentile, for these pictures had a big political
purpose to serve, and they demanded the
travel, the experience, and the mood that
Gian lacked. His brush was sufficiently
occupied with altar-pieces and portraits of
distinguished Venetians, now, alas, lost to
the world.</p>

<p>One incident that is not without its instructive
side in this connection is recorded
in the year 1501, when Isabella, Duchess of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
Mantua, sent her agent in Venice to Gian
Bellini to arrange with him to paint a secular
subject. The old painter, now in the neighbourhood
of his seventieth year, accepted
money on account, and then turned his
thoughts to other things. The agent worried
him from time to time with little or no effect,
and wrote despairing letters to the Duchess
to convey Bellini&rsquo;s various excuses. Not
until 1504, when the Duchess was proposing
to take legal action, was the picture finished,
and then it does not seem to have been what
was required. At the same time it must
have been a work of great merit, because a
year later we find the Duchess commissioning
another picture, and asking for a secular
subject, which the old painter after much
hesitation refused to paint.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span></p>

<p class="blockquot">This picture is from the Brera Gallery in Milan and is held by
many of the painter&rsquo;s admirers to be his finest presentment of the
Mother and the Son. It is certainly a work of most enchanting
beauty, one to which the eye turns again and again.</p>

<p>Happily Isabella d&rsquo;Este was not only a
voluminous letter writer, but her correspondence
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
has been preserved, and some forty
letters were written in connection with the
Bellini picture, by the lady whom Cardinal
Bembo called &ldquo;the wisest and most fortunate
of women,&rdquo; and of whom a poet wrote,
&ldquo;At the sound of her name all the Muses
rise and do reverence.&rdquo; She had seen Bellini&rsquo;s
work, and had admired it in Venice,
before she asked a friend, one Signor
Vianello, to secure a picture for her <i>camerino</i>.
At first the old painter raised objections,
says Vianello. &ldquo;I am busy working
for the Signory in the Palace,&rdquo; he said,
&ldquo;and I cannot leave my work from early
morning until after dinner.&rdquo; Then he asked
for 150 ducats and said he would make
time, then he came down to 100 ducats
and accepted 25 on account Then as has
been explained, he declared that he could
not undertake the class of subject that the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
Duchess wanted, and Isabella wrote to say
that she would accept anything antique that
had a fine meaning. Vianello writes in reply
to say that Bellini has gone to his country
villa and cannot be reached, and the correspondence
and the years pass, until at last
the Duchess gets quite cross and writes,
&ldquo;We can no longer endure the villainy of
Giovanni Bellini,&rdquo; and goes on to instruct
her agent to make application to the Doge,
Leonardo Loredano, the one whose portrait,
painted by Giovanni Bellini, is in our National
Gallery, to commit the old painter for fraud.
To this action Bellini responds by showing
Vianello that he has a &ldquo;Nativity&rdquo; three parts
finished, and after a time he sends it to the
Duchess together with a very humble letter
of apology, that the lady is good enough to
accept. She even writes, &ldquo;Your &lsquo;Nativity&rsquo;
is as dear to us as any picture we possess.&rdquo;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span></p>

<p>In 1506 Albert D&uuml;rer was in Venice where
he declares that he found the Venetians
very pleasant companions, and adds with
sly sarcasm that some of them knew how
to paint. At the same time he records his
fear lest any of them should put poison in
his food, but speaks in high terms and
without suspicion of Gian Bellini who had
praised his work and offered to buy a
picture. All these things are small matters
enough, but unhappily the records of
Bellini&rsquo;s life are so scanty that it is hard
to find anything more until the year 1513
when Gian Bellini, well over eighty, found
his position as official painter challenged by
his pupil Titian, who presented a petition
to the Council of Ten, stating <i>inter alia</i>
that he was desirous of a little fame rather
than of profit, that he had refused to serve
the Pope, and that he wanted the first<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
broker&rsquo;s patent that should be vacant in
the Fondaco de&rsquo; Tedeschi on the same conditions
as those granted to Messer Zuan
Bellin.<a name="FNanchor_1_2" id="FNanchor_1_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_2" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> The work that was being done
was the restoration of the Great Hall of
the Council, and the painting had been in
progress for some forty years, Gian Bellini
and two pupils being now engaged upon it.
There is no doubt that this application by
Titian annoyed Bellini&rsquo;s friends and pupils,
and even to us it seems a little unreasonable
and in bad form to clamour so eagerly for
a place that was already occupied. But it
would seem to have been the custom of the
time to apply early for any privilege of this
kind, for we find in later years that Tintoretto
applied for Titian&rsquo;s place long before
the older master&rsquo;s capacity for working had
come to an end.</p>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_1_2" id="Footnote_1_2"></a><a href="#FNanchor_1_2"><span class="label">[1]</span></a> This was the Venetian way of spelling Gian Bellini&rsquo;s name.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span></p></div>

<p>Bellini&rsquo;s friends were successful, although
it would appear that the old painter&rsquo;s progress
had been too slow completely to
satisfy the Council of Ten. In the following
year Titian, who had been allowed to start
work, was told that he must wait until older
claims were satisfied, the expenses of his
assistants were disallowed, and his commission
came to an end. In the autumn of
that year Titian brought another petition to
the Council, asking once more for the first
vacant broker&rsquo;s patent, and mentioning the
fact that Bellini&rsquo;s days could not be long in
the land. Just about this time the Venetian
authorities seem to have held an inquiry into
the progress of the work that was being
done in the Hall of the Great Council, only
to find that the amount of money they
had spent should have secured them a far
larger amount of work than had been<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
accomplished. It is hardly surprising that
these inquiries should have become necessary,
there must have been a great laxity
in the State departments in the years following
the working out of the plans that
had been made by France, Austria, Spain,
and the Pope at Cambrai. In the last few
years Venice had been fighting for her life,
Lombardy had passed out of her hands,
Verona, Vicenza, and Padua had followed.
The Republic had even been forced to seek
aid from the Sultans of Turkey and Egypt,
and although Venice was destined to emerge
from her troubles and light the civilised
world a little longer there is small cause
for wonder if, in the times of exceptional
excitement, her statesmen had not given
their wonted attention to the progress of
the arts. Doubtless Gian Bellini&rsquo;s leisurely
methods and failing strength were account<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>able
for the slow progress of the pictures
in the Council Hall, and Titian took advantage
of the fact to send in a third petition,
offering to finish some work at his own
expense, but he had no occasion to take
much more trouble.</p>

<p>On November 29, 1516, Gian Bellini died,
well on the road to his ninetieth year, &ldquo;and
there were not wanting in Venice,&rdquo; says
Vasari, &ldquo;those who by sonnets and epigrams
sought to do him honour after his
death as he had done honour to himself
and his country during his life.&rdquo; One cannot
help thinking that half-a-dozen pages
of biography would have been worth a
bushel of sonnets.</p>

<p>With Gian Bellini the last great painter
of purely religious subjects passed away.
He had stood between art and paganism.
Perhaps the younger men found him narrow<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
and pedantic, but it is certain that so long
as Gian Bellini was the leading painter of
Venice it was not easy for pictures to respond
to the ever growing demands that
followed the Renaissance. Now the road
was clear, painting was to reach its highest
point in the work of Giorgione and Titian,
and was then to decline almost as rapidly
as it had risen.</p>

<p>Gian Bellini for all the wide influence
that he exerted, not only upon contemporary
painting, but upon sculpture too, sent
very little work out of Venice. Examples
are to be seen in cities that are comparatively
close at hand, Rimini, Pesaro,
Vicenza, Bergamo, and Turin, but his
genius seems to have been too completely
recognised in his own city for his work to
travel far afield, and the portrait of himself
in the Uffizi Gallery is no more than a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
pupil&rsquo;s work with a studio signature. One
of his last undisputed paintings was for
the altar of St. Crisostom in Venice. It
is said that he painted it at the age of
eighty-five. After death his fame suffered
by the rise of those stars of Venetian
painting, Titian, Giorgione, and Tintoretto,
and throughout three centuries his work
was held in comparatively small esteem,
perhaps because it was often judged by the
studio pictures with the forged signatures.
As late as the middle of the nineteenth
century nobody seemed quite to know the
real pictures from the false ones, but with
the rise of critics like Crowe, Morelli, and
Berenson a much better state of things
has been established. Copies and student
works have been separated from the originals,
careful study of technique and mannerism
has made clear a large number of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
points that were doubtful and in dispute,
and although the process of separating the
sheep from the goats has reduced considerably
the number of works that can be
accepted as genuine, the gain to the artist&rsquo;s
reputation atones for the loss.</p>
